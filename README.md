# Breakersite
The Breakerbots website is divided up into two faces, a "Public" face and a "Private" face. The public face is targeted towards advertising and growing our robotics team, while the private face is used to manage many aspects of the team.

## Public Face
The Public face is the landing page for [breakerbots.com](https://breakerbots.com). The public has multiple sections including: about, robots, events, sponsors and contact information.
